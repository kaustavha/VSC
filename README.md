Consumer site for VXS/STI


Plans:

Use stellar.js to implement parallax scroll
Use Bootstrap 2.3.1 (current tested release) for responsiveness
Use BootStrap marketing theme as start. 

Production roadmap(planned):

0 --> 0.15.0 --> 0.3.0 --> 0.6.0 --> 0.9.0 --> 1.0.0

Start >> Get parallax functioning >> customize theme >> add marketing information >> implement CMS >> Bug fix/optimize/implement backward compatibility.

2 day - 1-2 days - 1-4 days - 1 day - 1 week

I'll possibly host test / beta @ kaustavha.github.io/vsc
