Consumer site for VXS/STI
Kasites


Plans:

waypoints.js FTW!
Use stellar.js to implement parallax scroll (done)
Use Bootstrap 2.3.1 (current tested release) for responsiveness 
Use BootStrap marketing theme as start. (directory structure set up)
FontAwesome toolbar icons with tooltips( still working on the tooltips)
CSS 3D --> no luck so far
(look at twitters bootstrap documentation , get checkboxes)


Production roadmap(planned):

0 --> 0.15.0 --> 0.3.0 --> 0.6.0 --> 0.9.0 --> 1.0.0

Start, pull page, setup >> Get effects functioning >> add marketing information & customize theme >> implement CMS and direct to backend entry >> Bug fix/optimize/implement backward compatibility.

1 day - 2 days - 1-4 days - 1-2 day - 1 week

I'll possibly host test / beta @ kaustavha.github.io/vsc
