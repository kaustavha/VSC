Plans:

Use stellar.js to implement parallax scroll
Use Bootstrap 2.3.1 (current tested release) for responsiveness
Use BootStrap marketing theme as start. 


Production roadmap(planned):

0 --> 0.15.0 --> 0.3.0 --> 0.6.0 --> 0.9.0 --> 1.0.0

Start, pull page, setup >> Get parallax & sticky header functioning >> add marketing information & customize theme >> implement CMS and direct to backend entry >> Bug fix/optimize/implement backward compatibility.

2 day - 1-2 days - 1-4 days - 1 day - 1 week
